	Implementing the software using programming languages and tools

	Testing, debugging, and maintaining the software

	Deploying the software in production environments

Q2
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Software Engineering is not just about coding but also includes:

	System Design: where we consider the architecture and components of the system.

	Requirements Analysis: where we study the stakeholders' needs.

	Testing: making sure the software works as intended.
Maintenance: keeping the software healthy and up-to-date.

	Documentation: writing down the design, architecture, and functionality of the software.

Traditional programming, on the other hand, is more focused on writing code to make the software work.

Q3
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that consists of seven phases ¹ ²:

1. Planning: The planning phase involves defining the project's purpose and desired results.

2. Requirements: This phase involves deciding on the features and components needed to achieve the final goal.

3. Design and Prototype: During this phase, developers design the software, including the layout, architecture, user interface, and security.

4. Software Development: In this phase, the developers start programming and building the system.

5. Testing: The testing phase involves evaluating the software to identify any bugs or errors.

6. Deployment: The deployment process involves pushing the software from the development environment to a live 
environment.

7. Maintenance: In this phase, the team maintains the software, fixes any errors, and plans for upgrades.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

	Agile Model: This model emphasizes developer-client communication and involves small, incremental changes from one release to the next.

	Waterfall Model: This model divides the project into discreet phases, each with its own tasks and objectives, and the team must execute each stage completely before moving on to the next one.

Q5
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, analyzing, documenting, and maintaining software requirements ¹. This process is crucial in the software development lifecycle as it ensures that the software meets the needs and expectations of its users. The requirements engineering process involves the following stages:

	Feasibility study: This stage involves determining whether the proposed software project is feasible.

	Requirements elicitation: This stage involves gathering requirements from stakeholders through various techniques such as interviews, surveys, and focus groups.

	Requirements analysis: This stage involves analyzing the gathered requirements to ensure they are complete, unambiguous, and consistent.

	Requirements specification: This stage involves documenting the analyzed requirements in a clear and concise manner.

	Requirements validation: This stage involves verifying that the specified requirements are correct and meet the stakeholders' needs.

	Requirements management: This stage involves managing changes to the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is important because it:

	Ensures that the software meets the users' needs and expectations.

	Reduces the risk of project failure due to misunderstood or missing requirements.

	Improves communication among stakeholders.

	Helps in estimating costs and schedules more accurately.

	Enhances the overall quality of the software.

Software design principles are general guidelines and best practices that are used to create software that is maintainable, scalable, and efficient. These principles are intended to guide the process of designing software and help ensure that it is well-structured, easy to understand, and easy to modify, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving the overall quality of the software ¹.

Some of the software design principles include:

	SOLID principles.

	Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY).

	Encapsulation principle.

Principle of Least Astonishment (PoLA).

	You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI).

	Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS).

These principles promote maintainability, scalability, flexibility, and readability, and help reduce the likelihood of errors and bugs in the software.

Q6
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in software design refers to the practice of breaking down a large software system into smaller, independent modules or components that can be developed, tested, and maintained separately. Each module is designed to perform a specific function or set of functions, and they can be combined to form a complete system.

Modularity improves maintainability and scalability in several ways:

	Reduced Complexity: By breaking down a large system into smaller modules, the complexity of the system is reduced, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain
	Faster Development: Modules can be developed independently and concurrently, reducing the overall development time.

	Easier Maintenance: If a problem arises in one module, it can be isolated and fixed without affecting the entire system.

	Reusability: Modules can be reused in other systems, reducing the need to Y code.

	Scalability: New modules can be added as needed, allowing the system to scale more easily.

Testing in software engineering is an essential process that ensures the software meets the required quality, functionality, and performance standards. There are various types of testing, including ¹ ² ³ ⁴:

	Manual Testing: Testing software manually without using automation tools.

	Automation Testing: Converting manual test cases into automated test scripts.

	White Box Testing: Testing the internal workings of the software, including code and structure.

	Black Box Testing: Testing the software functionality without knowing the internal workings.
	Gray Box Testing: Testing the software with some knowledge of the internal workings.

Q7
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

There are four main levels of software testing ¹ ² ³:

	Unit Testing: This level of testing examines the individual units of a system to ensure that they are functioning as intended.

	Integration Testing: This level of testing combines individual units and tests them together as a group.

	System Testing: This level of testing evaluates a complete and fully integrated system as a whole.

	Acceptance Testing: This level of testing is carried out before the product goes live and is used to help the customer evaluate the obtained result and check whether the system meets the acceptance criteria.

Testing is crucial in software development because it identifies defects early, improves product quality, increases customer trust and satisfaction, detects security vulnerabilities, and helps with scalability ². Additionally, testing can save money by catching errors before the 
software is released .
